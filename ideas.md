# Ideas
- marketplaceholder: compute max quantity from type before listing
- crafting overview: show what is missing to smelt an ore
- marktplaceholder: loading indicator before listings appear
- easy heat: when potential heat > 6000, change the heat display to a button that 1) activates a heat potion 2) drops all logs in the oven

## Dropped
- trackerdisplay: clicking on trackerdisplay should lead to market page (or already buying?)
